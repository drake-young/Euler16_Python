# Euler16_Python

Problem 16 of Project Euler solved in Python 3 using PyCharm. The solution to this problem is easily obtained because of python's typeless nature, allowing it to handle large numbers, like 2<sup>1000</sup> easily. 

## Project Euler Problem 16 -- Power Digit Sum

2<sup>15</sup> = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.

What is the sum of the digits of the number 2<sup>1000</sup>?
